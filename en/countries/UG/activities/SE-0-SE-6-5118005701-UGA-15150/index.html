<h2>Democratic Governance Facility 2014-2016 - DGF 2014-2016</h2>


<p>In 2011, seven bilateral Development Partners (DPs) and the EU established a facility called the Democratic Governance Facility (DGF). DGF aims at improving democratic governance and enhancing human rights in Uganda through support to state and non-state actors. The proposed contribution is a continuation of the previous support (49 MSEK) granted by Sweden 2011-2014. The current proposed support amounts to 49 MSEK during the period August 2014 to July 2016. The program objectives of DGF are:

1. More pluralistic, representative and accountable governance based on democratic values, institutions and processes. 
2.The people of Uganda, especially the poor, vulnerable and women are empowered to claim their human rights, access to justice and live in peace. 
3.Strengthened accountability and transparency of service provider at state and local government level.

The Royal Embassy in Kampala is the legal person for DGF and therefore the agreement partner of Sweden. Denmark has accepted to let the DGF act of behalf of the Embassy of Denmark to facilitate for the PMU to operate. This means that the Embassy of Denmark delegates authority to the Head of Programme of DGF by a letter of delegation to administer and manage the support. The letter fully delegates the responsibility to DGF for planning, implementation, follow-up and evaluation of its contributions to cooperation partners, including issuing disbursement requests to the DPs and forwarding of funds to the state and non-state actors. The funds that are disbursed by the donors are kept in an joint account in a bank in Kampala. After a project, assessed and proposed by the PMU, has been approved by the Steering Committe, DGF enters into an agreement with the cooperation partner on the basis of agreements based on Danida´s templates and forward funds to the partners. 

As Denmark has the ultimate legal responsibility for DGF, the facility complies with Danish law and the rules set out in the areas of procurement, audit anti-corruption, reporting etc. The DPs have examined and accepted the Danish rules. Sweden will use the template of Denmark for the funding agreement, a conclusion arrived at in consultation with Sida´s Legal Unit. The legal basis of the DGF was established in a Government-to-Government Agreement, signed on 5 July 2011 between the GoU and the Government of Denmark. Due to the decision by the Swedish Government not to enter into new agreements (or disburse on existing agreements) with the Government of Uganda, Sweden will not sign a specific agreement with GoU as was the case during the last project period. In addition to the bilateral funding agreement Sweden enters into with Denmark for this contribution, there is an Memorandum of Understanding between the DPs that support DGF, which Sweden has already signed when deciding on the previous support to DGF. The MoU is valid for the whole programme period, from June 2011 to June 2016. 

The organisational structure of the DGF includes the PMU, the Board and the Steering Committe and is based on clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Sweden, seven other DPs and the Government of Uganda are represented in the Board on Head of Mission level. The DPs are also represented in the Steering Committe at technical level. Although the PMU is given considerable mandate to operate by the letter of delegation from Denmark, it important to note that the Steering Committe and the Board carry out regular steering and monitoring of DGF:s operations, including management and follow-up of corruption cases. To enhance ownership and ensure efficient and sustainable interventions almost only Ugandan civil society and community based organisations and state institutions receive funding from DGF. In addtion, the support is needs-based and DGF strives to use Ugandan baselines and results indicators in the monitoring and evaluation of the projects.

A corruption case was discovered in one of DGF:s 85 projects in September 2013</p>
