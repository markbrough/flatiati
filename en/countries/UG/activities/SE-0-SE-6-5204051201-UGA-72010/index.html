<h2>Plan Sweden Humanitarian Program 2015-2018 - Plan Sweden DRM 2015-2018 (old strategy)</h2>


<p>Plan Sweden is implementing a three year project financed by Sida with focus on child protection and education in emergencies.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2017  In accordance with Sida decision 2016-002260, Sida will not include a selection of results in results registry but, as standard procedures at the Humanitarian unit, Sida will assess all of Plan&amp;apos;s individual projects&amp;apos; reports, including results framework.   According to Sida&amp;apos;s new regulations and advisors at Sida/VU there is no longer mandatory to follow-up the result register in TRAC nor will Sida request baselines or standard indicators. However, Sida do need to follow up results but rather on reported achievements and the theory of change used. Therefore, the following narrative will present the results achieved so far after Plan&amp;apos;s first year of the three years  agreement 2015-2018.   The below is based on the Annual report from Plan, the discussion during the Annual meeting 24th November, 2016, input from colleagues in the humanitarian team as well as a follow-up meeting with Mr Malte St√∂ving from Plan at Sida on 28th November, 2016.   During previous years Sida have been following closely Plan&amp;apos;s results reporting both regarding the Major Hum interventions and RRMs. Therefore, in this year&amp;apos;s narrative reporting Plan is presenting a well developed Results framework for both &amp;quot;Child Protection in emergencies&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Education in emergencies&amp;quot;. After having studied the logframe together with Sida&amp;apos;s advisors it can be stated that Plan is well following-up on the results even if the level of details is very ambitious. Sida&amp;apos;s recommendation to Plan will be to reformulate the outcomes in the next agreement to a more realistic level. Whether a three year or one-year intervention the expectations must be on an achievable level. There must be a clear distinction between knowledge and training to the beneficiaries and how much they can realistically put it into practise. For example to get the knowledge and skills about how to protect yourself or your children  will not automatically be put into practise for all. The same goes with access to services and referral mechanisms, it should be reported separately how many that have actually used the mechanism.   According to the report all activities have been implemented during the first year and Plan has responded to seven humanitarian crises in nine countries and has reached totally 356,027 beneficiaries.   Plan are reporting the following on six different outcomes;   i) Responding to identified needs in time;  All Plans projects are need based, often assessments are made together with other agencies. However, delays can occur due to security situation, governmental approval, procurement processes or lack of qualified staff.   ii) Coordination and access to information;  Plan is part of the Global Cluster Coordination system and IASC as well as other relevant coordination mechanisms. Plan is also the leading part in many child protection working groups.  iii) Accountability mechanisms;  Plan has during the period increased the number of projects that include a complaints/feedback mechanism. The ambition is also to make them child friendly with an appropriate and efficient mechanism for children. The guidance for this will be developed during 2016 and piloted in the start-up of projects in 2017.   iv) Girls, boys, men and women reached with qualified interventions;  For Protection and Education interventions boys and girls are the core focus. Water and Sanitation projects have a wider distribution among beneficiaries and Nutrition projects are mostly focusing on women and lactating mothers. Protection is the largest sector, i.e. 46% of the beneficiaries, Water and Sanitation 22% and the Education sector 14%, the remaining for Nutrition and Livelihood.   v) Child protection in emergencies;  The surge capacity funded during the year has vastly improved the progress towards reaching the Child Protection Minimum Standard. However, due to high demand, the CFSs have been overcrowded. This challenge must be solved and one solut</p>
