<h2>Umbrella fund, SRHR&amp;HIV prevention Uganda 2016-21</h2>


<p>Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) are an integral and important part of Sweden’s development policy and the feminist foreign policy, and essential to achieving equitable and sustainable development. 

Sweden’s long tradition of support to SRHR is strongly reflected in both the Swedish Government’s Aid Policy Framework and the Results Strategy for Sweden’s international development cooperation with Uganda, 2014-2018. 

SRH is a prioritized area for the Government of Uganda, but the sector remains underfunded hampering progress on SRHR indicators. In addition, progress is challenged by the fact that sexual rights continue to be a controversial and sensitive topic in the country. 

The International HIV/AIDS Alliance (IHAA) have applied to the Embassy of Sweden in Kampala for funding of MSEK 110 to manage and implement the “Uganda Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights Umbrella” (hereafter referred to as the SRHR Umbrella) during the 5-year period 2016-2021.

Sweden will sign an Agreement with the International HIV/AIDS Alliance (IHAA) who will have the overall programmatic and financial responsibility for the SRHR Umbrella. IHAA’s Linking Organization - Community Health Alliance Uganda (CHAU), will be the lead implementing partner in Uganda.

The intervention aims to “contribute to improved SRHR and HIV outcomes in Uganda” through four outcomes; 1) Expanded access and increased use of quality, inclusive and integrated SRHR and HIV services among vulnerable and key populations 2) Increased adoption of safer sexual practices among vulnerable and key populations, 3) An enabling SRHR and HIV environment for vulnerable and key populations, and 4) Strengthened institutional capacity of implementing organisations to deliver quality and inclusive SRHR and HIV programmes in Uganda. 

The SRHR Umbrella’s goal and outcomes will be achieved by increasing access to and use of quality, inclusive and integrated SRHR and HIV services and by promoting positive healthy sexual relationships that improve SRHR indicators by reducing STI/HIV transmissions, maternal mortality and the unmet need for family planning.

The umbrella will give high priority to promoting the full sexual and reproductive rights of individuals, and to addressing stigma and discrimination in all its complexity as an imperative for removing barriers to accessing health services.

Sweden and IHAA have a long-standing relationship. IHAA have received global support from Sweden since 1993 and is currently also receiving regional funding. IHAA’s linking organization in Uganda, Community Health Alliance Uganda (CHAU), recently (February 2016) received full accreditation as a linking organization. 

The SRHR Umbrella will identify 19 implementing partners through competitive calls for proposals and through rigorous capacity assessments. CHAU will sign individual agreements with each of the implementing partners who will be responsible for implementing agreed work plans and budgets. In addition the SRHR Umbrella will support 5 NGO&#39;s with innovation grants, bringing the total number of grant recieving partners to 24. 

A cornerstone in the umbrella is to develop and strengthen the capacity of the implementing partners in order to increase sustainability and local ownership. 

The 19 implementing partners will carry out different activities, including peer led interventions, youth friendly sexuality education and service provision, behavior change communication, community sensitization and outreach, policy briefs and dialogue, and social mobilization. 

The SRHR Umbrella will target 14 districts, primarily covering the central and western regions of Uganda (Buyende, Hoima, Jinja, Kabarole, Kamwenge, Kyenjojo, Luwero, Mbarara, Mubende, Ntungamo, Kampala, Mukono, Iganga and Nakaseke).

The districts have been selected basing on the following criteria: High HIV prevalence, high population of young people, low to medium ART/HCT coverage, high teenage</p>

<p>The overall goal of the SRHR Umbrella is to “contribute to improved SRHR and HIV outcomes” in Uganda though four outcomes:1. Expanded access and increased use of quality, inclusive and integrated SRHR and HIV services among vulnerable and key populations2. Increased adoption of safer sexual practices among vulnerable and key populations3. An enabling SRHR and HIV environment for vulnerable and key populations4. Strengthened institutional capacity of implementing organizations to deliver quality and inclusive SRHR and HIV programs in UgandaThe SRHR Umbrella’s goal and outcomes will be achieved by increasing access and use of quality, inclusive and integrated SRHR and HIV services and by promoting positive healthy sexual relationships that improve SRHR indicators by reducing STI/HIV transmissions, maternal mortality and the unmet need for family planning.The umbrella will give high priority to promote the full sexual and reproductive rights of individuals and to address stigma and discrimination in all its complexity, as an imperative for removing barriers to service access.</p>
