<h2>Support Women&#39;s Rights and Empowerment IWCE 2014 - Cost extention 33000084 women right</h2>


<p>The review of the overall performance of the programme concluded that the programme was on track with regard to working toward achieving results in line with Sida/Uganda country strategy and IWCE’s own Strategic Plan. Progress has been made towards achieving results along the 5 main objective areas.

The programme is considered to have achieved a great deal in a very short space of time and against a post-conflict backdrop in Northern Uganda. Overall, it is considered to have been very effective. In particular, the engagement with both the national women’s machinery (Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development - MGLSD) and women organisations seems to have been very strategic.

The capacity building support of the programme office to partners was generally appreciated and beginning to yield results. There is an emerging sense of shared purpose and values between IWCE and partners as the programme support from IWCE has enabled most organisations to develop their activities and skills further.

It was also found out that the programme strategies and interventions are well focused on improvement of the economic, social and political situation of the marginalised women in Uganda. The programme contributed to increased technical capacity of women organisations to implement women’s programmes at different levels. The strategies employed by IWCE are widely appreciated as whilst many institutions deal with the promotion of women, don’t seem to have used such relevant strategies that even helped improve the political participation of women in the concluded national elections in 2011. Demand for IWCE’s interventions and training is not only increasing amongst women, but also men who suffer from the same obvious lack of technical training.
Positive results were also noted on the Empowerment of women’s participation in politics during the recently concluded 2011 elections. The increase in the numbers of women candidates and the visibility of women’s issues during the campaign period was fundamental in increasing their chances to equally compete for elective office.

Other notably positive areas were IWCE’s programmes in the advocacy and policy areas. Significant gains were made especially within the legislative framework for pro poor and pro women legislations and policies. IWCE supported a campaign with legislators, women activists, women local councillors and representatives of CSOs that helped galvanise advocacy which culminated into the passing of the Domestic Violence Act by parliament and presentation of the Marriage and Divorce Bill. Although the Marriage and Divorce bill faced challenges in parliament, IWCE with all other stakeholders continue to engage and lobby for its passage.

The review team noted that while there is much work being done on women&#39;s rights, women&#39;s political participation and involvement of women in income generating activities, there is limited engagement of men in promoting gender equality. Patriarchal sentiments are still predominant. Gender equality awareness within communities is at a basic level and there are no pronounced efforts to change the status quo. Only a few instances were reported where IWCE activities have endeavoured to bring men on board in addressing gender inequalities. A glaring gap that exists in the country as a whole and within communities recovering from conflict in particular, is that men&#39;s gender issues are largely not addressed. Gender issues are seen as women&#39;s issues and few men are standing up to support gender equality. 

On the whole, the review report concluded that continued support be availed to IWCE to strengthen their reach and build on their successes to realise the development goals for women in Uganda.</p>

<p>The overall objectives is Promoting Gender Equality, Women’s Rights and Empowerment to enhance the capacity of Ugandan women and men to lead more effectively in poverty reduction, good governance and promotion of human rights.. The specific objectives are; 1.To advocate for enactment and monitor the implementation gender responsive laws, policies and programmes. 2. To increase networking at all levels to effectively engage institutions and governance structures for gender equality and promotion of Women’s rights. 3. To increase knowledge and articulation of women rights and gender through information sharing amongst members and stakeholders4. To promote and ensure women’s access to economic resources, power and decision making positions in all sectors and at all levels; improve the socio-economic conditions of women and other marginalised groups; work towards the achievement of equal opportunities and the rights for women in all sectors and increased access to and control of resources and benefits; improve women’s access to resources and to promote women’s empowerment and rights awareness through increased collaboration with local organisations.5. Provide support and associated capacity building to women organisations</p>
