<h2>aBi Trust Uganda 2015-2018 - aBi Trust 2015-2018</h2>


<p>The proposed decision refers to continued Swedish support to the Agricultural Business Initiative Uganda (aBi) Trust corresponding to SEK 40 million during the period 2015-2018. Financial support should be seen as a core support to aBi Trust for implementation in accordance with the business plan and budget for 2014-2018. aBi Trust aims overall to strengthen Uganda&#39;s competitiveness, and hence economic growth through increased productivity and value addition in the agriculture sector. Agriculture has untapped potential and is still the sector that employs most people in Uganda, particularly in rural areas. aBi Trust aims at reducing what is considered to be specific barriers/risks for the development of farming as a business (i.e. transition from subsistence to more commercial farming) through capacity development and access to financial resources and services that focus on the entire value chain in a number of prioritized commodities. Implementation is done through collaboration with private sector actors (companies and financial institutions), which in turn reaches out to the lower production levels (farmers and households).

aBi Trust will serve as implementing partner but Sweden will sign a so-called Agreement on Delegated Cooperation with Denmark in accordance with the principles of development effectiveness and donor coordination. The agreement has been negotiated in close collaboration with Sida&#39;s legal department and implies that the overall responsibility for monitor and follow-up will be delegated to Denmark. In relation to Sida&#39;s Rule on Contribution Management, there will be an exemption related to repayment of accrued interest to Sweden. Following the agreement, any income from accrued interest will be kept by aBi Trust, as part of the Swedish financial contribution. 

The Agribusiness Initiative Uganda consists of two different “legs”. aBi Trust that contributes to capacity development and access to finance and financial services to the actors in specific value chains and aBi Finance, which is an equity fund. The proposed decision includes only support for aBi Trust. In order to further strengthen the conditions for long-term financing of aBi Trust and to trigger development of more innovative financial products for increased lending and risk-taking among financial institutions, Sweden intends to initiate discussions on possible support for aBi Finance.

Sweden participated very actively when the aBi Trust initiative was developed and contributed with SEK 45 million during the period 2010-2013 (ref. UF2009 / 3764). The previous cooperation with aBi Trust has been good, and the Embassy is recognizing the good results achieved. aBi has managed to reach out to a large number of beneficiaries and evaluations (including control groups) indicate that the program has contributed to higher income generation and more productive jobs in the agriculture sector. This is a consequence of better utilization of land and improved access to markets and agricultural capital. Previous experiences justify continued Swedish support.

During the appraisal, the Embassy commissioned an external review to assess aBi Trust&#39;s financial control environment (call-off against the Embassy framework agreement for audit services). Following the general recommendations from this desktop review, it is concluded that Sweden is able to continue allocating financial support to aBi Trust. Important however to recognize the weaknesses identified, which need to be further assessed and followed-up during implementation. See also 2.2 below and further clarified in the risk register.</p>

<p>The overall objective of aBi is to contribute to increased income and employment in Uganda through environmentally and socially responsible improvements in productivity, quality and value addition in selected agricultural value chains.</p>
