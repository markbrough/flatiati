<h2>UNFPA SRHR 2015-2017 - Joint Programme for Population UNFPA</h2>


<p>UNFPA has proposed an intervention to enhance delivery of integrated sexual and reproductive health and rights and services in districts with high maternal mortality burden in Uganda. The embassy judges the intervention to be relevant and that it will contribute to the Swedish development cooperation strategy for Uganda, result area 3: Improved basic health and, more specifically, the objectives 1) improved access to high quality child and maternal care, and 2) Improved access to sexual and reproductive health and rights for women and men, girls and boys. Links between SRHR and women´s autonomy and empowerment are well documented, starting with a person´s right to decide over her/his body. The focus of the project in this field will hence move beyond the mere health aspect of reproductive health and into the democracy/right aspect of women´s empowerment. The preventive aspect of SRHR will also address the need to decrease strain on the overburdened health sector in Uganda as well as its spiralling population growth.

The sexual and reproductive health situation in Uganda is a mixed picture, with wide variations in achievements in across the country in access to and use of services such as facility-based delivery and modern contraceptive use (ranging from 7 per cent in Karamoja to 40 per cent in Kampala). Teenage pregnancy rates, unsafe abortions and rising HIV rates are of particular concern. Inadequacies in the health system to address the SRH/HIV situation include a shortage of human resources for health with 1,400 vacant posts for midwives, suboptimal emergency obstetric care services, stock outs of essential drugs, and poor infrastructure. Socio-cultural, economic factors and gender inequality deter access to services by rural communities particularly adolescents, and other marginalized groups. Poorly coordinated community mobilization and engagement coupled with inadequate male involvement in health restrict women and young people from utilizing available services. 

Given the above, UNFPA has designed an intervention to increase availability and use of rights-based, integrated SRH services that meet standards of quality of care and equity in access for women, young people, sex workers and LGBT persons in 10 high-need districts in post-conflict areas of Uganda (plus 4 HIV hubs). The strategic objectives of the intervention are 1) To strengthen the capacity of the health system to deliver rights-based Reproductive, Maternal, New-born and Adolescent Health services to high maternal mortality burdened regions of the country; and 2) To mobilize institutional structures including community, religious and cultural leadership for increased utilization of stigma-free SRH/HIV services. 

The intervention will build on previous support to UNFPA from the embassy, which was conducted in eight districts for reproductive health and rights and five other districts for HIV/AIDS activities (51180038: Support to UNFPA to improve maternal health services in Uganda 2011-12, Kamp 22/2011 and 51180046: Decision on contribution to UNFPA, Strengthening Capacity for Quality Maternal Health Services, Youth Friendly and HIV Protection, Kamp 12/2013). This intervention expands and concentrates lessons learned in the previous support to a geographic area that is particularly disadvantaged compared to the rest of the country. The embassy sees this as an advantage for two reasons. First, the 10 districts that have been chosen for the current intervention are concentrated to Northern and North-eastern Uganda, which are “post-conflict” areas. The support can thus be seen as helping bring these provinces up to the same level as the rest of the country. Secondly, the chosen districts also overlap with the seven districts where the embassy is preparing to support UNICEF during the same period. The advantage of this is that the two agencies, with different but complementary mandates, will thus be able to help the coinciding 7 post-conflict districts t</p>
