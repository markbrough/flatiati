<h2>Capacity Development in Land Administration</h2>


<p>The programme was developed jointly by the Liberia Land Authority (LLA) and the Swedish Mapping, Cadaster and Land Registration Authority (Lantmäteriet), based on the results of a fact-finding mission which had been funded by the Embassy of Sweden in Monrovia.

LLA is a new government agency in Liberia, with a core mandate to undertake actions and implement programmes in support of land governance, including land administration and management in Liberia in the interest of citizens’ equitable access to and use of land. This includes administering the deed registry and land registry systems, public survey and mapping services, and the promotion, support and development of land use plans and zoning schemes (and their implementation). As a new government agency, LLA lacks adequate funding for operations and has extremely low capacity in land disciplines, making it extremely difficult to carry out its statutory responsibilities. 

The Lantmäteriet is a Swedish Authority with a framework agreement with Sida. Lantmäteriet has experience from international cooperation with “sister” public authorities in its areas of expertise, such as IT support, property registration systems, infrastructure for geodata and land management issues, in Africa (e g Botswana and Rwanda) as well as Eastern Europe (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia and Kosovo). The framework agreement provides for the purchase of services (tjänsteköp inom staten) by Sida for capacity development of government agencies in Sweden’s partner countries in development cooperation, where Lantmäteriet can be assigned projects without public procurement given their unique competence and function. 

The overall goal of the proposed intervention is to contribute to “inclusive, transparent, effective and efficient delivery of land management and administration services in Liberia”. 

In addition, the proposed intervention is expected to have effect on the wider land sector, including capacitating civil society to carry out outreach and information campaigns on women’s land rights and improving the tenure security of customary land-owning communities through improved systems for land demarcation and registration. 

Strengthening LLA’s capacity for more effective donor coordination is an integral part of the project, which will ensure more effective use of the available resources across all priority areas of the LLA, including increasing LLA’s presence outside Monrovia where the need will be high.

The expected outcomes of the proposed intervention are:
•	Needed skills and knowledge of LLA staff considerably improved and LLA staff are effectively and efficeintly carrying our their respective duties and responsibilities;
•	Women participating in land administration and management;
•	Local government creating and enforcing Land Use Plans;
•	Customary and protected land demarcated and managed.

The proposed intervention is expected to be achieved through institutional cooperation between Lantmäteriet and LLA covering a proposed 5-year period (2018-2023). Lantmäteriet requests a total amount of SEK 71.3 million and it will be Sida’s main agreement partner responsible for the implementation of the project. Lantmäteriet will in turn sign a cooperation agreement or MoU with LLA, regulating the division of labour between the two institutions in the implementation of the programme. Lantmäteriet shall not forward funds to the Liberia Land Authority, instead they will provide technical, mentoring and material assistance to the LLA.

LLA will perform major parts of the work to achieve the expected outcomes, supported by the Swedish experts and others involved with the project. The project manager, an employee of Lantmäteriet, will be stationed full-time in Liberia, and will plan, manage and monitor the programme with the mandate to act within the approved agreement, plans and budget, and coordinate the activities of the Swedish Experts as well as support, guide and advise the LLA, as requested and needed</p>

<p>The overall objective of the proposed intervention is &#39;inclusive, transparent, effective and efficient delivery of land management and administration services in Liberia&#39;. The achieve its overall objective, the project identified the following outcome areas: -Needed skills and knowledge of LLA staff considerably improved and they are effectively and efficiently carrying out their respective duties and responsibilities.-Women participating in land administration and management functions as a result of increased awareness and capacity within LLA and at the levels of counties, CSO´s and the public, supported by a gender mainstreamed legal framework (Women participating in land administration and management). This is abbreviated to mean: Women participating in land administration and management-Increased capacity in Land Use Planning in Liberia allowing local government structures to develop and enforce Land Use Plans, according to guidelines from LLA, involving the local communities (Local government creating and enforcing Land Use Plans). This is abbreviated to mean: Local government creating and enforcing Land Use Plans-Customary land demarcated and managed.</p>
