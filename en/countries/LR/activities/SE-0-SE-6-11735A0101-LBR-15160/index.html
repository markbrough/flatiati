<h2>Support to the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in Liberia</h2>


<p>The proposed intervention will support the protection of the rights of citizens and
residents of Liberia and address the structural and systemic gaps in policies, practices
and legislation that escalate human rights violations. The justice and security system in Liberia has received increased criticism for its lack of compliance with human rights standards including the police, courts and correction services. 

The Independent National Commission on Human Rights (INCHR) of Liberia was established in 2005 for the promotion and protection of human rights in Liberia, as a result of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2003. INCHR was set up in line with the Paris Principles as a national HR institution. Although established in 2005, the Commission was not functional until 2010. The support to the INCHR will enable the institution to investigate human rights violations, promote human rights education and support preventive mechanisms. 

OHCHR is the lead UN entity on human rights. In 1993, the General Assembly entrusted both the High Commissioner for Human Rights and OHCHR with a unique mandate to promote and protect all human rights for all people. Through the Human Rights and Protection Service (HRPS) section of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), OHCHR has been engaged in the integration and institutionalization of human rights in Liberia since 2003. In anticipation of the closure of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in March 2019, the OHCHR Liberia stand-alone country office was established to contribute to the consolidation of achievements made after UNMIL and to ensure sustained peace, reconciliation and conflict prevention. OHCHR signed its host country agreement with the Government of Liberia on 1 April 2018. OHCHR is the only UN entity in the country with a comprehensive mandate to monitor human rights, report on its findings, and provide technical assistance to State institutions and civil society organizations based on its findings.

The overall objective of the proposed intervention is “enhancing human rights protection
to promote sustainable peace in Liberia”. In line with the Paris Principles for National Human Rights Institutions, the INCHR needs to become an independent and credible institutions in the eyes of the population. To this end, the proposed intervention will strengthen the internal institutional systems of the INCHR with the view to achieving organisational efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. The capacity of the INCHR to train, deploy, equip and supervise human rights monitors in all 15 counties of Liberia will be enhanced to ensure its presence outside Monrovia, necessary to achieve credible human rights monitoring, documentation and reporting that meets minimal standard of professionalism. In addition, the independent monitoring of the human rights situation in Liberia by the OHCHR separately as well as in conjunction with the INCHR is expected to enhance the improvement of the respect of human rights of persons in detention and of persons coming into contact with the security and justice system. Well-functioning redress mechanisms and access to remedies for persons who feel aggrieved by the State and its institutions will enhance confidence in the State at both national and local levels.

Thus, the following five outcomes are expected to be achieved:

-	To increase the capacity of the Independent National Commission on Human Rights to fulfil its mandate to monitor and report human rights and to enhance the accountability of duty-bearers and access to remedy for rights-holders.

-	To enhance INCHR’s capacity to engage and collaborate with CSOs so that the voices of marginalised and discriminated groups are heard.

-	To increase INCHR’s county level presence with qualified, trained and well-resourced field staff to ensure the protection of human rights across the country.

-	To increase INCHR’s capacity to mainstream gender and ensure greater visibility to the righ</p>

<p>The support to OHCHR is directed at achieving the following four outcomes/objectives: Outcome 1: to increase the capacity of INCHR to fulfil its mandate to monitor and report human rights and enhance accountability of duty bearers and access to remedy for right holders. Outcome 2: to enhance INHCR&#39;s capacity to engage and collaborate with CSOs so that the voices of marginalized and discriminated groups are heard and with relevant government departments to facilitate cooperation with and among them to ensure greater opportunities for designing interventions and strategies for corrective action. Outcome 3: to increase INHCR&#39;s county level presence with qualified, trained and well-resourced field staff to ensure the protection of human rights across the country. Outcome 4: to increased INHCR&#39;s capacity to mainstream gender and ensure greater visibility to the rights of women and girls in its advocacy, policies, operations, and activities. Outcome 5: to increase INHCR internal institutional capacity to improve accountability and transparency </p>
