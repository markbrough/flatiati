<h2>The Carter Center Access to Justice 2</h2>


<p>The Embassy has received a request from the Carter Center for renewed support for the Access to Justice program. The Embassy agreed with the Carter Center that the draft proposal for the embassy for the new phase would include a component to support the execution of free, transparent and peaceful elections. Elections are a burning challenge for Liberia this year and Carter Center has previous experience of election support in Liberia. Consequently, the Carter Center has proposed to include and expand its electoral work in 2017, focusing on citizen and electoral education, national electoral observation and the prevention of electoral violence within the framework of this initiative.

The overall objective of the support is to strengthen Liberia&#39;s peace by enhancing citizens&#39; access to justice, strengthening the legal certainty at the county level and promoting free, transparent and safe elections. Carter Center has addressed this in four goals and associated activities: 1) Improve information dissemination and citizens involvement in and confidence in election processes 2) Increase access to justice by offering free legal information and dispute settlement services 3) Strengthen the capacity of traditional leaders to work for good governance and local law enforcement; and 4) an improved policy framework to increase opportunities for judicial review at local level. The above objectives are achieved, inter alia, through support for legal advisers, capacity building of traditional leaders and local structures, support for short and long-term national observation, policy support to harmonize the various legal systems and support for local dispute settlement mechanisms.

The support aims to increase legal certainty for poor men, women, boys and girls in Liberia. The reconstruction of the formal justice system in the countryside after almost collapsing during the civil war continues; thanks to international support. Liberia has a dual legal system with both formal and customary courts. The lack of competent personnel, infrastructure and resources characterizes the formal judicial system which has a huge lag. Traditional custom is recognized by the Constitution and occurs in most parts of the country. The traditional rule of law, led by traditional leaders, is usually more accessible and effective, but risks leading to inadequate respect for human rights in general and, in particular, the enjoyment of human rights by women and other minority groups. Studies show that only a small percent of all legal cases reach the formal system. Carter Center therefore works to strengthen the mechanisms of law enforcement that de facto handle most legal cases and disputes.

The Access to Justice program has for several years been working to build capacity within customary structures to contribute to increased capacity and ability to accountability, and that these structures are in line with human rights. The effort is also aimed at strengthening the link between the various legal systems. The consciousness and knowledge of the population about the formal legal process is low. Carter Center also works to inform the people about the laws and duties and rights of citizens under the country laws.</p>

<p>The overarching goal of the proposed programme as outlined in the programme document is &#34;Strengthening peace in Liberia by enhancing citizen ownership of government, strengthening the rule of law at the community, and preventing violence&#34;. This is in full accordance with the overarching goal of Sweden&#39;s strategy on development cooperation in Liberia 2016-2020 which is Peace and State Building.  Specific objectives of the programme are stated as follows: 1. Improve information, citizen engagement, and confidence in a peaceful electoral process; 2. Provide effective free legal information and dispute resolution services; 3. Strengthen the capacity of traditional leaders to advance and implement good governance and community justice practices, and; 4. Support a policy framework to increase access to justice at the community level.  Regarding the election work in 2017, TCC aimed to contribute a to safe, inclusive and fair elections through civic education, national long-term and short-term observation of the election and violence prevention. They were mobilising a diverse range of influential community actors to conduct civic education, to provide support to community violence prevention mechanisms, and to train and support a long-term citizen observation of the electoral process which will be equally important in the post-election phase. TCC also deployed 1000 short-term election observers on the election day through Liberia Election Observation Network (LEON). The continued post-election support to LEON has the objective of improving information, citizen engagement, and confidence in government and peaceful electoral process. The Access to Justice programme is aimed at contributing to access to justice for all and improving local good governance and conflict resolution. This comprises work with customary and local mechanisms offering free legal advice and conflict mediation services; strengthening the capacity of traditional leaders to promote good governance and community justice practices and; improve the national policy framework to support access to justice at the Community level.  Furthermore, by providing support to national policy level development processes linked to justice and good governance, the Carter Center aims to strengthen and decentralise access to such processes in Liberia. The programme demands and promotes inclusive participation, cooperation and trust between different societal actors, which is needed to sustain peace and provide justice to all Liberians.  The concluding assessment of the Embassy is that The Carter Center has formulated relevant programme objectives and a realistic intervention logic that is likely to contribute to the impact objectives.</p>
